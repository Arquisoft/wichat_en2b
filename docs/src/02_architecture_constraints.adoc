| Constraint | Justification
| **Web-Based System** | The system must be a web application, accessible via a browser, ensuring broad accessibility and ease of deployment.
| **Frontend Technologies** | The frontend must be developed using modern web technologies (e.g., React, Vue, or Angular) to ensure responsiveness and maintainability.
| **Backend Framework** | The backend should use a scalable platform such as Node.js, Django, or Spring Boot to support API interactions and user management.
| **Database** | A relational or NoSQL database (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB) must be used to store user data, game progress, and question history efficiently.
| **Cloud Deployment** | The application must be deployed on a cloud-based infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud or Oracle) to ensure availability and scalability.
| **External API Integration** | The system must integrate with Wikidata and an LLM API for question and hint generation. API rate limits and response times should be considered.
| **Performance Constraints** | The application must provide real-time interaction with the LLM for hints and ensure fast response times (<1s for hints, <3s for question generation).
