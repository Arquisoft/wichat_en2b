== Deployment View

=== Infrastructure Level 1

The application will be deployed on an oracle server, using docker to run the different modules of the application. The application will use the wikidata API to get the different questions and answers of the game and an LLM API to do calls to the llm so that the user can interact with it and, for example ask for hints.

All of this will be deployed in an oracle server running ubuntu with the help of docker.

**Motivation**

The motivation behind the design of this application is to create a scalable, flexible, and secure system that can efficiently integrate with external APIs (such as Wikidata), while providing seamless user interactions through a web application. The core of the system revolves around managing various API calls, handling data storage, and ensuring a robust system that can keep up with the user demands.

To achieve this, we utilize a containerized microservices architecture, where each service (such as the Game Service, User Management, and API Gateway) is isolated in its own container. This separation allows for efficient scaling, improved fault tolerance, and the ability to update individual services independently. Additionally, the use of MongoDB ensures flexible, high-performance storage, while the API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all external and internal communication, providing load balancing, routing, and security functionalities.

The overall design enables the application to handle varying levels of demand, from individual user interactions to large-scale data processing, all while maintaining a high degree of security and performance. This approach not only supports future growth but also ensures that the system is easy to maintain and evolve over time.
