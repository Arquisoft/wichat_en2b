== Introduction and Goals

=== Requirements Overview

The goal of this project is to enhance the online "Saber y Ganar" quiz show application, developed last year by HappySw, with new features that incorporate large language models (LLMs) and Wikidata for a more interactive and engaging experience and a multiplayer mode where the host code of the session allows mulitple players to share the same quiz game in real time with session leaderboard.

The key functional requirements of the system are:

* A Web frontend that presents pictures with questions for the users to answer.
* Users must be able to register, login, and view historical data related to their game performance (e.g., number of games, correct answers, time taken).
* The system should automatically generate questions and answers using Wikidata.
* Hints for the questions can be obtained through interaction with an external LLM via an API.
* The LLM should mitigate the generation of incorrect answers or hallucinations when providing hints.
* Each question will have a correct answer and multiple distractors, all generated automatically.
* The application must be deployable on the web and allow users to access their information via a documented API.

=== Quality Goals
The quality goals for the architecture are as follows:
[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Description
| *Scalability*  | The system must efficiently handle a high number of concurrent users without performance degradation, ensuring a seamless experience even under peak loads.
| *Reliability*  | The system must operate consistently under expected conditions, maintaining stability and minimizing downtime or unexpected failures.
| *Usability*    | The application must be intuitive, easy to learn, and user-friendly, enabling players to navigate, answer questions, and request hints effortlessly.
| *Performance*  | The system should deliver fast and responsive interactions, ensuring minimal delays when generating questions, processing answers, or providing hints.
| *Security*     | User data must be securely stored and accessible only to authorized users. The system must protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and malicious activities.
|===
These quality goals will drive architectural decisions, particularly concerning how data is processed, stored, and presented to the user, as well as how external integrations (e.g., LLM API and Wikidata) are handled.

See section 10 (Quality Requirements) for a complete overview of quality scenarios.
