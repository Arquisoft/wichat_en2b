== Solution Strategy

In this section of the documentation we are covering the fundamental decisions and solution strategies of our project architecture.  These decisions were made with a strong focus on addressing the constraints defined in xref:02_architecture_constraints.adoc[Section 2: Architecture Constraints].

=== Technology decisions

[options="header", cols="1,2,2"]
|===
| Technology | Context | Why?
| **https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript[JavaScript]** | Main language used in the project | Due to our familiarity with developing web projects using JavaScript and its easy learning curve. Moreover, it is one of the most popular languages in web development today.
| **https://nodejs.org[Node.js]** | Environment for the project development | Allows the execution of JavaScript at runtime and is multiplatform. It is highly compatible with our main development language and is open source.
| **https://reactjs.org[React]** | Frontend development of our web application | Widely used in the web app industry, React facilitates efficient view development with techniques familiar to our team. Its learning curve is also relatively gentle for beginners.
| **https://expressjs.com[Express]** | Backend/core of our web application, managing client requests | Express is straightforward to understand and leverages familiar concepts like functional programming, delegate functions, and a request/response HTTP controller structure.
| **https://empathy.co/[Empathy API]** | LLM service to provide the chatbot experience. Currently under evaluation with consideration for alternatives (e.g., Empathy). | Empathy.co is a privacy-first search and discovery platform designed for eCommerce. With AI-driven search capabilities, intuitive interfaces, and a focus on trust, Empathy.co helps brands enhance customer engagement while respecting privacy. The platform supports seamless integrations, real-time insights, and customizable search solutions, empowering retailers to build meaningful shopping journeys. The demo project showcased good response times and appropriate latency, with unlimited API calls.
| **https://www.wikidata.org[WikiData API]** | Provides information required for answering client questions during game interactions | Its easy-to-use API and the SPARQL query language enable the development team to handle diverse information requests efficiently. Additionally, its use is a project constraint.
| **https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt[Bcrypt]** | Module for encrypting sensitive application data | Offers robust hash encryption with the ability to increase the salt parameter for improved security. Its interface meets our requirements for user-related services.
| **https://getpino.io[Pino]** | Module for providing a logging system | Chosen over alternatives (Winston, Log4j-node, etc.) for its fast, straightforward logging and native JSON support, which simplifies readability and parsing.
| **https://www.docker.com[Docker]** | Automates deployment using containerized services | Docker is currently the industry standard for containerized deployments, offering excellent performance and ease of management.
| **https://www.oracle.com/cloud/[Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)]** | Hosts the application in the production stage | Selected due to our ability to obtain a free, sufficiently powerful server instance from Oracleâ€™s infrastructure.
| **https://gatling.io/[Gatling]** | Load testing tool for performance evaluation | Chosen for its ability to simulate multiple users and analyze application performance under load. It provides detailed reports and metrics, helping identify bottlenecks and optimize the system.
| **https://pptr.dev/[Puppetter]** | E2E testing library to control high-level operations in browsers | It's compressible methods and as it was configured initially in the template of the project
| **https://socket.io/[Socket.io]** | Library that allows using WebSockets to communicate clients and server bidirectionally and event-based | It's easy syntax and good event handling performance based in polling what was needed for the Wihoot implementation
|===

=== Architectural design decisions
The project architecture is divided in different modules and their functionalities are delimited following a Layered pattern. Therefore, taking that in mind we can classify the project as follows.

. Frontend

- **Webapp** +
  Module that manages the pages shown to the client and communicates with the Gateway module via requests.

. Controller

- **GatewayService** +
  Endpoint of the web application that communicates the frontend with the business logic.

. Service

- **UserGateway** +
  Endpoint of user information related requests. This endpoint is used to isolate the access control to user's information.

- **UserAuthenticationService** +
  Module that manages the login operation and verifies the client connection.

- **UserCRUDService** +
  Module that carries the CRUD operations with users with the DB. Moreover, it also manages groups of users and retrieves all user-related information.

- **GameService** +
  Module that carries the game logic of the application quizzes, interacts with the LLMService and with the WikiData interface.

- **LLMService** +
  Module that acts as an interface to communicate with the LLM provider API in a decoupled way. Allowing the application to consider future changes in the API provider with the same functionality.

. Persistence

- **MongoDB** +
  Module of persistence that stores the user's information in JSON format.

=== Design patterns applied

In our solution we are applying some design patterns to be aware of future changes of features in the code. Therefore, we can highlight the following patterns:

* **Facade** (Unifier Interface) +
    As our project will use a gateway arquitecture, we are abstracting some intern endpoints using a forwarding functionality in our gateway service.

* **Observer**
    Wihoot service multiplayer game is based in an event polling of the WebSockets joined to the same game session code. The logic of this is handled by the socket.io module.


=== Decisions trade-offs

[options="header",cols="1,1,2"]
|===
| Decision | Alternatives |  Features rejected in the decision
| **JavaScript** | Java and C# | By using JavaScript as the main language, we reject features such as pure OOP, which Java and C# provide. The development team is well-versed in these paradigms and feels more confident using them. Moreover, using a dynamically typed language instead of a statically typed one increases the risk of runtime errors and validation issues.
| **Node.js** | Spring Boot and .NET | As a consequence of choosing JavaScript as the main language, we also dismiss Spring Boot as a web development framework, despite having some experience with it. Additionally, we opt against .NET technologies, which are widely used in the industry and have comprehensive, unified documentation provided by Microsoft.
| **React** | Thymeleaf and JSP | By using React, we reject HTML template engines such as Thymeleaf and JSP (which are more common in Java environments), despite having some familiarity with them.
| **Express** | Spring Boot or JEE | By choosing Express, we dismiss the use of Spring Boot or JEE libraries for implementing web event controllers, along with their annotation-based approach, which simplifies application logic and functionality distribution.
| **Empathy API** | Grok LLM, Gemini LLM, and Deepseek LLM | By using this API, we take the opportunity to participate in the Empathy challenge. Additionally, rejecting Google's Gemini LLM and Deepseek LLM may reduce chatbot performance, as these models are evolving faster than Empathy's.
| **WikiData API** | None | This was a project constraint.
| **Bcrypt** | Crypto (Built-in Node.js) | The built-in Node.js Crypto module reduces external dependencies. However, it provides a more generic and basic interface, which may simplify implementation.
| **Pino** | Winston | By rejecting Winston, we lose its flexibility in supporting multiple log formats and advanced configuration options.
| **Docker** | Podman and Kubernetes | By using Docker instead of Podman, we reject Podman's decentralized daemon architecture, which enhances deployment security. Additionally, Podman consumes fewer resources by running each container as an independent process. Furthermore, by choosing Docker, we dismiss Kubernetes' superior performance in deploying high-availability and scalable applications.
| **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure** | Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS) | By choosing Oracle Cloud Infrastructure as our deployment platform, we opt against Azure, which provides student licenses but may have higher costs for long-term use. Additionally, we reject AWS, which offers better scalability and a more flexible pricing.
| **Gatling (Not yed decided)** | Apache Jmeter and Locust.io (among others) | By using Gatling, we reject ache Jmeter and Locust.io, which where also presented load testing tools. Gatling is known for its high performance and scalability, making it suitable for simulating large user loads. It provides detailed reports and metrics, helping identify bottlenecks and optimize the system.

=== Decisions on how to achieve the key quality goals

[options="header",cols="1,2"]
|===
| Quality Goal | Strategy
| **Scalability** | Using Gherkin with tools to test the performance and behaviour of the application in users load scenarios. The tool used to test the user load is yet to be confirmed, but we chose Gatling.
| **Reliability** | The development team will apply a TDD (Test-Driven Development) to ensure that the business model behaves correctly. Besides, with an automatized Continuous Deployment strategy, the development team can deploy the project often and explore the application behaviour, considering that the logger system implemented will catch each bug occurred during the execution.
| **Usability** | Our development will follow good desing practices such as implementing i18n technology to allow internationalization, respecting the W3C standards in web design where possible and
| **Performance** | Using different modules specialized in monitoring the application, as Prometheus and Grafana. Besides, to identify possible bottlenecks in our application we are using Node profiling tools as `node --prof`.
| **Security** |  Our application is using encrypting modules in the registry of new users and their authentification. Moreover, we have centralized the access to the application backend in a gateway service, hiding the endpoints of the application to the ones we decided.
|===

=== Organizational decisions

To ensure an efficient and structured development process, we have established the following organizational strategies:

* **Version Control and Collaboration**

We have adopted a **Trunk-Based Development** approach using **Git**, where **each branch** is dedicated to completing a **specific issue**. Merging changes into the main (trunk) branch **requires a pull request** that must be reviewed and approved by at least one other team member. This ensures code quality, reduces integration issues, and reinforces team collaboration, preventing over-specialization.

Additionally, **issues could be handled by multiple team members**, using the GitHub **Discussions** section, promoting team problem-solving and reducing bottlenecks. Moreover, during *team meetings* we must **review each developer issues progress** to **identify potential difficulties** and provide support, whether by offering new perspectives, detecting bugs, or adding new unit tests cases.

* **Project Management and Workflow**

We use **GitHub** as our **primary version control tool**, and also using its **integrated Kanban board** to **track progress** (Projects section in GitHub). Issues are categorized and can transition through the following states:
--
    . No Status
    . TODO
    . In Progress
    . Testing
    . Done
--

* **Continuous Deployment and Stability Checks**

Once the application reaches a deployment stable functionality, we will **implement a Continuous Deployment methodology**. This involves **deploying** the application **at least once per week, to verify stability in a production-like environment**. This proactive approach helps **detect** and resolve **deployment-specific bugs early**, preventing major issues from being discovered too late in the process.

=== Implementation decisions

* **How are solved the LLM hallucinations?**

We have implemented a filter function that process LLM responses to exclude any of the possible quiz answers. If a forbidden word is detected, the system retries the request a limited number of times, and if the response of the LLM is wrong then it shows an error message: "There was an error while returning your answer, please try again." To avoid any prompt engineering attempt to obtain the answer.

Known Limitations:

--
1. Exact Matching: The filtering mechanism only detects exact matches of possible answers, potentially missing paraphrased answers.

2. Retry Limit: Fixed at a finite number of retries, which may not suffice for complex cases.
--

* **How are questions fetched/retrieved in our application?**

- Adding Quiz Categories

We have defined an endpoint `POST /quiz` that accepts JSON format with different body parameters as `category`, `wikidataQuery`, `wikidataCode`, ... Once the request is done automatically performs multiple requests to WikiData and stores questions for later retrieve in the quiz.

- Retrieving Questions

We have defined an endpoint `GET /game/{subject}/{numberOfQuestions}/{numberOfOptions}` to retrieve the questions stored in the database regarding the subject of the quiz.

Known Limitations:

--
1. Assumes valid images paths and sufficient questions/answers to retrieve or fails.
--

* **How is designed our multiplayer functionality?**

The multiplayer functionality of the quiz game is designed to enable real-time, shared quiz sessions where multiple players can join, compete, and interact under the coordination of a host. It leverages a combination of Express.js for session management, MongoDB for persistent storage, and Socket.IO for real-time communication, as implemented in the Wihoot microservice.

Known Limitations:

--
1. You have to be registered to create the game session and to join to the game session code
--
