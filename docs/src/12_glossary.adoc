| Backend               | The server-side component of the system, handling API requests, game logic, and data management.
| Large Language Model (LLM) | An external AI model integrated into the system via an API to generate hints for quiz questions, aiming to avoid hallucinations or incorrect responses.
| Wikidata              | A free, collaborative knowledge base providing structured data, used by the system to automatically generate quiz questions and answers.
| API                   | Application Programming Interface; a set of rules allowing communication between software components, e.g., RESTful APIs for user data and question creation.
| Question Generation   | The process of automatically creating quiz questions, correct answers, and distractors using data retrieved from Wikidata.
| Hints                 | Contextual assistance provided to users during gameplay, generated by the LLM via an API call, based on the question or user input.
| Distractors           | Incorrect answer options presented alongside the correct answer in quiz questions to challenge the user.
| Game Modes            | Different gameplay variations, e.g., “Each wise man with his subject,” “Travel with us,” or “The hot question,” offering diverse user experiences.
| Scalability           | The system’s ability to handle a large number of simultaneous users without performance degradation, a key quality goal.
| Reliability           | The system’s robustness in handling failures (e.g., LLM API downtime) while maintaining a seamless user experience, a key quality goal.
| Usability             | The ease with which users can navigate and interact with the application, ensuring an intuitive and engaging experience, a key quality goal.
| Performance           | The system’s ability to provide fast responses (e.g., <1s for hints, <3s for question generation), a key quality goal.
| Security              | The protection of user data through encryption, authentication, and compliance with GDPR, a key quality goal.
| Game Service          | A backend service managing game logic, question presentation, and interaction with external APIs (Wikidata and LLM).
| RESTful API           | A style of API design using HTTP methods (e.g., GET, POST) for communication between the frontend, backend, and external services.
| CRUD Operations       | Create, Read, Update, Delete operations managed by the system for handling user data in the database.
| Gateway Service       | The central entry point for routing external and internal API requests, ensuring security and load balancing.
| Players               | End-users of the application who register, login, and participate in the quiz game, expecting an enjoyable and dynamic experience.
| Administrators        | Users responsible for managing game content, monitoring system performance, and maintaining integrity, typically from ChattySw or RTVE.
| Cloud Deployment      | The practice of hosting the application on a cloud infrastructure to ensure availability, scalability, and ease of maintenance.
| Hallucinations        | Incorrect or fabricated responses generated by the LLM, which the system aims to mitigate when providing hints.
